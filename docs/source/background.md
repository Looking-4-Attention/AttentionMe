## Background

Have you ever felt the urge to be the center of attention? Just like the lyrics from *Hype Boy* by New Jeans,
> "You got me looking for attention."

With AttentionMe, you can make that a reality. The library focuses on preprocessing videos and images to enhance the userâ€™s presence. It provides tools for:

- Background removal
- Zoom In
- etc.

Keep that in mind, this project was developed to promote teamwork and deepen our understanding of **open source software** development practices by the undergraduate students.
